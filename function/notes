Scenario 1:
Create a function updateQuantity(action, quantity) that:

Increases the quantity if action is "increase".
Decreases the quantity if action is "decrease" but does not go below 1.
javascript
Copy code
updateQuantity("increase", 1); // Output: 2
updateQuantity("decrease", 1); // Output: 1
Scenario 2:
Write a function to handle clicks on multiple + and - buttons for a list of products:

html
Copy code
<div class="product">
    <button class="decrease">-</button>
    <span class="quantity">1</span>
    <button class="increase">+</button>
</div>
Each button should only update the quantity for its respective product.
Scenario 3:
A cart stores the following items:

javascript
Copy code
const cart = [
    { id: 1, name: "Product A", price: 20, quantity: 1 },
    { id: 2, name: "Product B", price: 30, quantity: 2 },
];
Write a function to:

Increase the quantity of an item by its id.
Recalculate and display the cart's total price.
Scenario 4:
Write a function to dynamically display a "Remove" button for a product if its quantity is set to 1. Clicking "Remove" should delete the product from the cart.

Challenge
Create a small JavaScript program with the following functionality:

A list of products displayed with + and - buttons.
Dynamically update the total price for all products combined when quantities change.
Store the updated cart data in Local Storage so it persists across page reloads.
These questions and scenarios will strengthen your understanding of the topic. Let me know if you need help solving any of these!

Your <p> element with the id="quantity" and class="price" can be dynamically updated in JavaScript. Let’s dive into how you can manipulate it for an e-commerce web app scenario using the + and - buttons.

Example Scenario
You have buttons to increase and decrease the quantity, and the quantity is displayed in this <p> element. Here's how you can make it functional:

If you're looking for JavaScript questions similar to your scenario—managing dynamic data like a shopping cart, working with DOM, and using localStorage—here are a few challenging yet practical examples:

Question 1: Shopping Cart Management
You are given a shopping cart stored in localStorage with the following format:

json
Copy code
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Laptop", "price": 800, "quantity": 1 },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Phone", "price": 500, "quantity": 2 }
]
Write the following functions:

getTotalPrice(): Calculate and return the total price of items in the cart (price × quantity).
addItem(newItem): Add a new item to the cart. If the item already exists (based on id), increase its quantity.
removeItem(itemId): Remove an item from the cart based on its id.
saveCart(): Save the cart back to localStorage.

...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Question 2: Dynamic Product Rendering
Write a JavaScript function renderProducts() that takes an array of products and dynamically renders them as cards in the DOM. Each card should display:

Product image (img)
Product name
Price
Two buttons: Add to Cart and Remove from Cart
When the Add to Cart button is clicked:

Save the product to the cart (stored in localStorage).
When the Remove from Cart button is clicked:

Remove the product from the cart.

.............................................................................................................................................................................................
Question 3: Quantity Update in Cart
Given an array of cart items:

javascript
Copy code
let cart = [
  { id: 1, name: "Shoe", price: 100, quantity: 1 },
  { id: 2, name: "Shirt", price: 50, quantity: 2 }
];
Write the following functions:

incrementQuantity(id): Increment the quantity of a product in the cart.
decrementQuantity(id): Decrease the quantity of a product in the cart. If the quantity reaches 0, remove the item from the cart.
Ensure all updates are saved to localStorage.
........................................................................
..................................................................

Question 4: Wishlist Management
Create a "Wishlist" feature. Write JavaScript to:

Toggle an item between the cart and the wishlist.
Ensure that an item cannot exist in both at the same time.
Save both cart and wishlist to localStorage and reflect the changes on the UI.
Question 5: Search Functionality
Create a search bar for products. Write a JavaScript function searchProducts(keyword) that filters the products array based on the search term (case-insensitive) and displays matching products on the UI.
.......................................................................
........................................................................
Question 6: Cart Summary
Given the cart data:

javascript
Copy code
let cart = [
  { id: 1, name: "Book", price: 20, quantity: 3 },
  { id: 2, name: "Pen", price: 2, quantity: 5 }
];
Write a function getCartSummary() that returns:

Total items in the cart (sum of all quantities).
Total cost of items in the cart.
